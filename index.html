            I am a 2nd year biostatistics PhD student at the University of
            California, San Diego School of Medicine
            working with Dr. Xin Tu and Dr. Victor De Gruttola. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in applied mathematics
            at
            California State University, Fullerton. My research interests lie in statistical methods for appropriate
            public health response to the AIDS epidemic. Currently, I work on approaches for missing survey data in
            Botswana to understand the transmission of HIV and the impact of antiviral treatment between communities.

            Previously, I was a data analyst intern at the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project and a
            participant in the 2017 Summer Program in Biostatistics and Computational Biology at the Harvard T.H. Chan
            School of Public Health where I worked with Dr. Sherri Rose.

        <h2>Multimodal Biometrics for User Authentication on Mobile Devices
        </h2>
        <h4>Advisor: Mikhail Gofman, PhD</h4>
        <p>
          Generally, modern mobile devices identify users based on a single biometric such as face, fingerprint or
          voice.
          Prior works have shown that a greater identification accuracy can be obtained by implementing feature-level
          fusion on multiple biometrics. We propose a novel feature-level fusion approach for combining
          histogram-oriented
          gradients features from the face with mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features from the voice. The
          classifiers we consider are KNN, LDA, QDA, RF and SVM. We find that for all classifiers, the multimodal
          approach
          significantly outperforms the unimodal face and voice approaches while taking less than 0.02 seconds to
          identify
          a user on a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone.

        <h2>Predicting the Fragility of a Country</h2>
        <h4>Advisor: Sherri Rose, PhD</h4>
        <p>
          Fragile countries are considered to be countries with unstable governments and politics along with limited
          resources. Identifying fragile countries may allow government officials and related personnel to anticipate
          changes in needed aid to minimize the severity of the effects from natural disasters and disease outbreaks.
          Using socio-economic data, we implement classifiers to predict fragile countries. Classifiers we considered
          were
          GLM, GLMNET, GAM, Classification Tree and Pruned Classification Tree. We have that a classification tree
          obtains
          the highest accuracy (90%) and a respectable R2 and AUC, while utilizing only two out of nine of our predictor
          variables, which is beneficial due to the difficulty of obtaining data from fragile countries.

        <h2>Assessing Spatial and Temporal Variances of the Toxicity Levels of the Southern California Bight with Linear
          Mixed Models
        </h2>
        <h4>Advisor: Laura Smith, PhD</h4>
        <p>
          The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) implements a regional monitoring program for
          the Southern California Bight (SCB). Data collected from sampled points of interest are used by SCCWRP to
          assess
          the toxicity levels of the SCB. In the past, SCCWRP used an equal number of new and previously visited sites
          for
          sampling. The decision of the ratio of new sites versus previously visited sites is of importance to SCCWRP.
          Using previously collected data, we use mixed-effect models to determine spatial and temporal variances of
          toxicity and abundance of metals. We have that the spatial variances exceeds the temporal variances for both
          variables. We conclude that the ratio of new sites and previously visited sites be adjusted in favor of more
          new
          sites for a better assessment of the SCB.

        <h2>Risk Parity Control Portfolio Optimization with l <sub>1</sub> Regularization using Split Bregman</h2>
        <h4>Advisor: Laura Smith, PhD</h4>
        <p>
          Often, portfolio optimization methods result in a portfolio divided among many assets, which is not ideal for
          transaction costs. Therefore, some existing methods use the l<sub>0</sub> norm in the objective function to
          promote sparse solutions. Using the l<sub>0</sub> norm results in a nonconvex objective function, often
          requiring complex methods to solve. We adapt the objective function from Feng and Palomar to include an
          l<sub>1</sub> norm and use Split Bregman method to obtain the optimal and spare solution. We find that our
          proposed model produces sparse results with a lower volatility in comparison to various methods including the
          Feng-Palomar model while obtaining a significantly faster run-time than the Feng-Palomar model, especially
          when
          consider a large number of assets.
