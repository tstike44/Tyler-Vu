          I am a 2nd year biostatistics PhD student at the University of
          California, San Diego School of Medicine
          working with Dr. Xin Tu and Dr. Victor De Gruttola. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree in applied mathematics
          at
          California State University, Fullerton. My research interests lie in statistical methods for appropriate
          public health response to the AIDS epidemic. Currently, I work on approaches for missing survey data in
          Botswana to understand the transmission of HIV and the impact of antiviral treatment between communities.

          Previously, I was a data analyst intern at the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project and a
          participant in the 2017 Summer Program in Biostatistics and Computational Biology at the Harvard T.H. Chan
          School of Public Health where I worked with Dr. Sherri Rose.

      <h2>Multimodal Biometrics for User Authentication on Mobile Devices
      </h2>
      <h4>Advisor: Mikhail Gofman, PhD</h4>
      <p>
        Generally, modern mobile devices identify users based on a single biometric such as face, fingerprint or
        voice.
        Prior works have shown that a greater identification accuracy can be obtained by implementing feature-level
        fusion on multiple biometrics. We propose a novel feature-level fusion approach for combining
        histogram-oriented
        gradients features from the face with mel-frequency cepstral coefficient features from the voice. The
        classifiers we consider are KNN, LDA, QDA, RF and SVM. We find that for all classifiers, the multimodal
        approach
        significantly outperforms the unimodal face and voice approaches while taking less than 0.02 seconds to
        identify
        a user on a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone.

      <h2>Predicting the Fragility of a Country</h2>
      <h4>Advisor: Sherri Rose, PhD</h4>
      <p>
        Fragile countries are considered to be countries with unstable governments and politics along with limited
        resources. Identifying fragile countries may allow government officials and related personnel to anticipate
        changes in needed aid to minimize the severity of the effects from natural disasters and disease outbreaks.
        Using socio-economic data, we implement classifiers to predict fragile countries. Classifiers we considered
        were
        GLM, GLMNET, GAM, Classification Tree and Pruned Classification Tree. We have that a classification tree
        obtains
        the highest accuracy (90%) and a respectable R2 and AUC, while utilizing only two out of nine of our predictor
        variables, which is beneficial due to the difficulty of obtaining data from fragile countries.

      <h2>Assessing Spatial and Temporal Variances of the Toxicity Levels of the Southern California Bight with Linear
        Mixed Models
      </h2>
      <h4>Advisor: Laura Smith, PhD</h4>
      <p>
        The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project (SCCWRP) implements a regional monitoring program for
        the Southern California Bight (SCB). Data collected from sampled points of interest are used by SCCWRP to
        assess
        the toxicity levels of the SCB. In the past, SCCWRP used an equal number of new and previously visited sites
        for
        sampling. The decision of the ratio of new sites versus previously visited sites is of importance to SCCWRP.
        Using previously collected data, we use mixed-effect models to determine spatial and temporal variances of
        toxicity and abundance of metals. We have that the spatial variances exceeds the temporal variances for both
        variables. We conclude that the ratio of new sites and previously visited sites be adjusted in favor of more
        new
        sites for a better assessment of the SCB.

      <h2>Risk Parity Control Portfolio Optimization with l <sub>1</sub> Regularization using Split Bregman</h2>
      <h4>Advisor: Laura Smith, PhD</h4>
      <p>
        Often, portfolio optimization methods result in a portfolio divided among many assets, which is not ideal for
        transaction costs. Therefore, some existing methods use the l<sub>0</sub> norm in the objective function to
        promote sparse solutions. Using the l<sub>0</sub> norm results in a nonconvex objective function, often
        requiring complex methods to solve. We adapt the objective function from Feng and Palomar to include an
        l<sub>1</sub> norm and use Split Bregman method to obtain the optimal and spare solution. We find that our
        proposed model produces sparse results with a lower volatility in comparison to various methods including the
        Feng-Palomar model while obtaining a significantly faster run-time than the Feng-Palomar model, especially
        when
        consider a large number of assets.
